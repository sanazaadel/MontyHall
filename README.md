## Monty Hall Problem Simulation    
This project simulates the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The simulation allows users to see the outcomes of switching versus staying with their initial choice over multiple trials.   
### Features    
- Simulates the Monty Hall game with options to switch or stay.     
- Compares win rates for both strategies over a specified number of trials.    
- Visualizes results using Streamlit for easy interpretation.       
### Requirements    
- Python 3.x    
- Streamlit    
### Installation    
1. Clone the repository:    
   ```bash
   git clone        
2. Navigate to the project directory:    
   ```bash
   cd MontyHall    
3. Install the required packages:    
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt    
### Usage    
1. Run the Streamlit dashboard:    
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/dashboard.py    
2. Adjust the number of trials using the sidebar slider to see how switching versus staying affects win rates.
