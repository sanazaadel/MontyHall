# MontyHall

This project simulates the Monty Hall problem, a famous probability puzzle based on a game show scenario. The simulation allows users to understand the counterintuitive results of switching versus staying with their initial choice.

## Features
- Simulates multiple rounds of the Monty Hall game.
- Calculates win rates for both strategies: switching and staying.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `main.py` notebook to see the simulation in action. 
3. Adjust the number of trials to see how it affects the win rates.
